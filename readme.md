# MPEG Audio Collection

## Notes

**This repository was imported from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mac/**

The project used cvs for version control system at SourceForge and it contained the versions until version 2.91 alpha 4. The versions after that were added manually by extracting the files from the published archives.

## Info

MAC is an ultimate freeware utility for Windows 95/98/NT/2000/ME/XP

It is designed to organize your audio file collection.  
It is fast and easy to use, scans selected drives for supported audio files and lists them in an Explorer-style tree-view interface.  
You can retrieve all information about your audio collection and you can play files as well.
