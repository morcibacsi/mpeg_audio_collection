    <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally MAC 2.92 stable is here! A little 
    explanation for those that haven't heard it yet: MAC was originally created 
    by Jurgen Faul, but since he stopped the development, it is now developed by 
    The MAC Team. Which currently has 4 members: Böreck, ErikS, Gambit and madah. 
    We would like to thank Jurgen for his great work and we hope that we can 
    follow in his footsteps :).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; So, what are you 
    waiting for? Go get the new version at the <a href="download.html">download page</a>!</span></font><p>
