      <li><i><a name="What is MAC">What is MAC?</a><br>
      </i>MAC means MPEG Audio Collection. It will help you to organize your 
      audio file collection. There are some nice features like a Tag editor, 
      file renamer utility etc. </li>

    <ul>
      <li><i><a name="Why is MAC so different from the others MP3 managers">Why is MAC so different from the others MP3 managers?</a><br>

      <li><i><a name="What multimedia formats does MAC accept">What multimedia formats does MAC accept?</a><br>
      </i>MAC supports the MPEG Audio format (*.mpa, *.mp1, *.mp2, *.mp3), 
      MPEGplus (*.mp+, *.mpc), Windows PCM (*.wav), TwinVQ (*.vqf), Ogg Vorbis 
      (*.ogg), Monkey's Audio (*.mac, *.ape), Windows Media Audio (*.wma), AAC 
      (*.aac), WavPack (*.wv), FLAC (*.flac), and OptimFROG (*.ofr) files. </li>

      This is a viewer for

      </i>MP3 files must be linked with a player. You can test it: just double 
      click on a MP3 file in MS-Explorer. If it goes to play, then MAC can do it 
      as well. If not - you should assotiate MP3 with a player. </li>

      <li><i><a name="What is VBR">What is VBR?</a><br>
      </i>It is short for &quot;Variable bit rate&quot;. Some MP3 encoder support this. If 
      there are very complex parts in a song it will use a quite high bit rate 
      and e.g. on silence or easy parts it will use a lower bit rate. So usually 
      the average bit rate will be not as high as the bit rate of an MP3 of the 
      same quality with constant bit rate. </li>

      </i>Depending on how the MP3 files were encoded, this can happen. If they 
      were encoded incorrectly or by using a software application that does not 
      perform this task properly, the internal track time in the MP3 file may be 
      incorrect. </li>
