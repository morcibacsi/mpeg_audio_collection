MPEG Audio Collection 2.92+ (14. May 2005)
-------------------------------
 - added autosorting & autosaving after adding a new volume
 - added Tag editor (directly edits files from list,if they are exist,only mp3 & ogg for now)
 - search result displaying changed
 - Lyrics3 v2 Tag support (read & write)
 - TPreview component changed from 3.01 to 4.61

 works, but buggy:
 - remove entries from list (information on summary remains there)
 - physically remove files from disc (information on summary remains there)
  (it should be: [Volume Size]-[Removed Files' Size] 
     and it is : [Volume Size])
