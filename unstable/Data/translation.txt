MPEG Audio Collection: translation


Adapting the program to a different language
--------------------------------------------

MAC has been written to take full advantage of the language independence.
All program messages, menus, dialog box texts etc. are stored
outside of the program in resource files.

Currently, 33 languages are supported:

  - Afrikaans                - Hungarian
  - Arabic                   - Italian
  - Bulgarian                - Latvian
  - Catalan                  - Lithuanian
  - Chinese                  - Norwegian
  - Croatian                 - Polish
  - Czech                    - Portuguese
  - Danish                   - Romanian
  - Dutch                    - Russian
  - English                  - Serbian
  - Estonian                 - Slovak
  - Finnish                  - Slovenian
  - French                   - Spanish
  - Galician                 - Swedish
  - German                   - Thai
  - Greek                    - Turkish
                             - Ukrainian

To adapt MAC to another language only the *.lng file has to be translated.
For a native speaker of the language this will take one to two hours.
The author would appreciate to get a copy of the translated resource file
for inclusion in the next public release. 

If you make any changes in the existing language files, please let me know.
