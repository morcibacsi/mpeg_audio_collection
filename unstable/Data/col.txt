MPEG Audio Collection: COL file format


Description for the COL file format.
(I'm sorry for my bad english)

1.
The COL-file consists of many Lines (Rows).
Each line has information about one Object.
There are 4 object kinds: Collection, Volume, Folder, File.

2.
Each object is on an ordained place in the file tree: Level is the count of
symbol #9 (TAB) at the beginning of each line. The first line has level 0
(no TAB symbol), and so on...

3.
Each object kind consists of ordained info Clusters. Each cluster separated
with one symbol from other neighbour clusters. There are different symbols
for separate.
