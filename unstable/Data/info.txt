Description:
------------

Having a large audio collection can become a very difficult task, if there
is no proper way to organize it. MPEG Audio Collection makes the task
relatively easy and puts the fun back into listening to your favorite
songs. It doesn't group all the songs together into one large database,
making sorting routines difficult and time consuming. But what it does
is provide a volume by volume listing of your CD or HDD contents, integrated
with a search engine so that you can find out all titles specifically by 
music groups, so that you know exactly which songs you have in your collection.
The program starts quickly and it's very practical to have a desktop shortcut
to it, useful especially if you have a large collection.

Here is a general description of the icons that the program uses:

- NEW: Starts a brand new session of scanning CDs HDDs for MP3s to organize.
- OPEN: Loads a previously saved session.  
- STATISTICS: Lists total file size in gigabytes, total amount of duration
      of collection (calculated to the hour), average bit size, volume count,
      folder count, file count and last date change.

      specific needs.

- VOLUME LIST: Allows user to select volume(s) to remove from generated 
      catalog or merge in one volume. 
- SORT ALL: Sorts all files within all volumes (note: this does not group
      and sort all files together).
- SEARCH: A very diverse search engine. Generates a list of files found within
      users specified needs. Can be saved to a file to be printed out.
- TAG EDITOR: You can decide which of these particular fields are important
      when adding Mp3s to your catalog.
- FILE RENAMER: You can rename files with extracted ID3-tag info.
- CD COVER: Allows you to design a CD cover for your jewel cases.
